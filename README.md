# CMCC-DART ASSIMILATED OBSERVATION MONITORING
This is a set of Fortran and python codes for evaluating output from the CMCC Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART), using popular Python libraries like matplotlib and basemap.

To monitor the total number of observation used and assimilated in enseble based CMCC-DART with the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM). The codes are mostly written to accomodate all types of statistics including bias, RMSE, ensemble spreed, observation influance and many more.

# Diagnosis of observation, background and analysis-error statistics in observation space
This folder contails a single FORTRAN program named "ALL_OBS_EXTRACT.F90" to extract informations from  CMCC-DART "obs_sequnce" output files.
